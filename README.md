# Bybit Bot

This repository contains tools for interacting with the Bybit P2P marketplace.

## Bybit P2P Reference

The `reference/bybit_p2p/` directory holds copies of modules from the public Bybit P2P library. These files are provided **only** as an English reference for available methods.

Importing any code from this directory is strictly forbidden. All interaction with Bybit P2P must use the dedicated client via `from bybit_p2p import P2P`, which is already configured elsewhere in this project.
